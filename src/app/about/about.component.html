<p class=".space">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and type setting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has 
survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into 
 electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the
release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum 
passages, and more recently with desktop publishing 
software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of
                                       Lorem Ipsum.
